# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

This is the first project of the Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity. The main objetive is to create a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

This project is based on a Kaggle dataset ([click here for more details](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers)) about identifying credit card customers that are most likely to churn.
